I will be using the Pytorch library to train a model with hundreds of images of unique plants and testing it later to see if it is able to correctly identify the plant.

My Objectives: 
- Become familiar with the basic uses of Pytorch
    - Train a model on plant images
    - Learn and be able to explain how the code functions
